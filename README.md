# React-Image-Carousel

A sample web project that i'm using to practice how to use React by building a simple web carousel component and sharpen react usage on tools like fontawesome
 icons and basic css styling.

it's is a standalone image component of a react caruosel or slider( built using vite, react, vanilla( html, css ) ). This project is just to illustrate my usage and to also learn preliminary parts of react( such as: class components, states, etc ). It's a complete beginner project and posses no advance level code just plain react.
